# Reliable Early Skin Cancer Detection
Results and Experimental setup for reliable early skin cancer detection
## Methodology
- Feature extraction using ResNet50, VGG19, EfficientNetB0
- Classical ML classifiers: KNN, SVM, RF, LR, XGBoost
- Ensemble learning with hard majority voting
- Misclassification reanalysis to reduce false negatives
